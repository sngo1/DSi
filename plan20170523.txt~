Center of Your Universe
           We plan to create an augmentable solar system using a combination of compsci and physics in the backend and Processing in the front end. The user will start with a Sun that rotates on its own(maybe we’ll add a big bang at the beginning if we can figure it out). Then, they will be provided with three choices of what to include next, three of one of the following: asteroid, randomized planet, star. They can select one of those and will be given a speed and a direction associated with it. Using that information, they can click where they want to place it, and it will incorporate itself into the solar system, whether it moves in seamlessly or destroys a planet. A new object will appear in the box they selected before, so they’ll once again have three options total. As of now, they won’t be able to remove anything or deselect a choice from the selection boxes; they would have to restart the program.

    Which jobs are most crucial?
    Which components constitute core functionality (vs non-essential)?
    Which components are prerequisites for others?
    Which tasks can be delegated, and which must be collaboratively tackled?

    What is the timeline, and how does it accommodate setbacks, course changes?
