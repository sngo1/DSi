## The Big Bang Theory
Welcome to your very own solar system! This is a solar system simulation, where you will be able to add and remove asteroids, planets, and stars. We hope you enjoy a peek into an alternate universe!
#### In this universe, you can choose to...
- ##### Add an asteroid - after clicking this button, click once anywhere in the solar system. The asteroids appears at the asteroid button and moves in the direction your mouse is in. The farther away the mouse is, the faster the asteroid goes.
- ##### Add a planet - after clicking this button, click anywhere in the solar system to start a circular orbit around the Sun. 
- ##### Add a star - after clicking this button, click anywhere in the solar system to place an immobile star.
- ##### Remove last added object - click on the remove last button.
- ##### Delete an object - click on the delete button, then click on what you want to delete. If you don't want to delete anything but have already clicked the delete button, click on the button again, or any other button.
## FAQs
#### Q: There are too many choices! I can't decide what to put in my universe.
A: Try the **RANDOM** button and let artificial randomness decide for you.
#### Q: I don't like that last thing I put in; that was a poor aesthetic choice. How do I get rid of it? 
A: Use the **REMOVE LAST** button to remove the last thing that was added.
#### Q: What if I want to remove one thing that wasn't the last thing but I still want to keep the last thing and also learn CS jargon so I can better communicate my common-user problems? 
A: You can use the **DELETE** button. First, select the button. Then, select the object you want to remove. *Warning: Objects in motion may be difficult to catch.

We thank you for your time and value your opinion. We hope you will stay with us until the release of DSi's Pocket Solar Systems 2.0!
