#### FAQs
##### Q: There are too many choices! I can't decide what to put in my universe.
A: Try the RANDOM button and let artificial randomness decide for you.
##### Q: I don't like that last thing I put in; that was a poor aesthetic choice. How do I get rid of it?
A: Use the REMOVE LAST button to remove the last thing that was added.
##### Q: What if I want to remove one thing that wasn't the last thing but I still want to keep the last thing and learn CS jargon so I can better communicate my common-user problems?
A: We thank you for your time and value your opinion. We hope you will stay with us until the release of DSi's Pocket Solar Systems 2.0!
